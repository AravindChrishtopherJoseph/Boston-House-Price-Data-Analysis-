Buyers near the river are more price-sensitive to negative factors like pollution and crime.


Zoning and planning play a critical role in determining value in riverfront areas — high ZN and low density attract higher MEDV.


Older riverfront houses may be luxury or heritage homes, contrasting the general trend where age lowers price.
